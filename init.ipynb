    "The other day, I came across a tiktok that made me do a double take. Data enthusiast MillenialMoron had shared some graphs which compared how the housing crisis was experienced between the US and Canada. The data he shared was shocking, it seemed as though the Canadian working class was 4x worse off than their American counterparts. This fact, if true, would be almost unbelivable to most Canadians. My data antennas started buzzing and my had to look deeper. "

It certainly gives the impression that Canada's housing market has spiraled out of control since the 70s, in a way that dwarfs the housing market in the United States. However, the choice of data here seems strange and arbitrary. Why is the  graph based on the relative change of housing prices to the disposable income of an average 1970s individual? \n",

Housing prices in Canada were nearly half that of the US (and the rest of the developed world) in the 70s, and the apparent explosion has more to do with our market 'catching up' than spiraling out of control. \n",

All the same, this viral phenomenon serves as a warning to how misleading the scale can be when comparing graphs that track *relative* change. \n"
