Data enthusiast MillenialMoron had shared some graphs which compared how the housing crisis was experienced between the US and Canada. The data he shared was shocking, it seemed as though the Canadian working class was 4x worse of than their American counterparts, a fact that, if true, would be almost unbelivable to most Canadians. My data antennas started buzzing and my had to look deeper. "
